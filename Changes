Revision history for EVDB::API

0.99 Aug 2006
  - Structural updates to allow EVDB::API to use the YAML or JSON "flavors"
    provided by api.evdb.com.  Also provides support for XML::Twig parsing,
    which may perform better on some systems. (Thanks, Daniel!)
  - Added a default set of force_array options for common API methods.
    This set will probably be split out into another package with 
    more frequent updates.
  - Last revision (hopefully) before releasing 1.0 and finding a permanent home.

0.9  Jul 2005
  - Updated call() to accept file upload fields.  Specifically, any parameter
    that ends with "_file" will be treated as a local filename and uploaded
    along with the method call.
  - call() now accepts either a hash reference (as before) or an array
    reference (a la HTTP::Request::Common) for the parameter key-value pairs.
    This allows multiple values to be sent for the same key.

0.8  Jul 2005
  - Improved error handling.  $EVDB::API::errcode now provides
    the machine-readable error, while $EVDB::API::errstr
    provides a human-readable description.

0.7  Jun 2005
  - Updated to match changes to API user_key and app_key.

0.6  Jun 2005
  - Removed ._* files from tarball.

0.5  Jun 2005
  - First publicly-available version.
  - Provides login() for digest (token) authentication. 
  - Catches XML errors and sets $EVDB::API::errstr.
